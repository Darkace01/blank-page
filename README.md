# Blank Screen

This was created out of frustration of not wanting to turn off my second monitor when I just want to focus on one screen. It's a simple app that would fill your second monitor with a black screen. It also has some fun feature to change the color randomly and also a fun mode to do that continuously.

It was created out of necessity and I'm not sure if it's useful to anyone else. But I'm putting it out there in case it is.

## Unnecessary Features

- [x] Change color randomly
- [x] Change color continuously
- [x] Show Random Quote using [Random Quotes API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable)
